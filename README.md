# Project Title: Real-Time File Monitoring System

---

## Description:
This project implements a real-time file monitoring system consisting of a client and a server component. The client monitors changes in a specified data folder and its subfolders, sending the updated file information to the server. The server listens for incoming data from clients and logs the received file information along with the client's IP address.

---

## Client Component:

- Upon startup, the client sends file information from its data folder and subfolders to the server.
- After receiving acknowledgment from the server, the client begins monitoring changes in the data folder and subfolders.
- When a change occurs (such as file renaming, deletion, addition, or modification), the client captures the new tree path of the data and subfolders and sends it to the server.

## Server Component:

* The server listens on the specified port for incoming connections from clients.
* Upon receiving data from a client, the server logs the received file information in the "server_data.log" file.
* The log format includes the client's IP address followed by details of each file: filename, size, and last modification date.
* The server updates the file list if the client is still present in the log file.

```


- Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd real-time-monitoring-client-server-in-c
```


- Compile the project using the provided Makefile by running the command

```bash
